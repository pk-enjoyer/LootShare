/**
 * Immutable-ish data model representing a single segment of a session thread.
 * <p>
 * How sessions are tracked overall
 * - The plugin tracks "threads" of activity consisting of a root (mother) session and
 * zero or more child sessions. A new child is created whenever the roster changes AFTER
 * at least one event has been recorded, preserving historical rosters for split math.
 * - The root (mother) session has motherId = null and represents the thread start. The first
 * active child is created immediately when a thread starts so that events and roster are
 * always associated with a child segment. All subsequent children reference the same motherId.
 * - ManagerSession owns a Map<String, Session> of all sessions and switches the current active
 * child by storing its id. ManagerSession also forks new children on roster changes and
 * appends events to the active child.
 * <p>
 * What each Session holds
 * - id: unique identifier (UUID string) used as the key in ManagerSession's map and persisted.
 * - start/end: timestamps for this segment; end == null indicates the segment is currently active.
 * - motherId: null for the mother/root; otherwise the id of the mother that all children share.
 * - players: the roster for this segment (names are stored as mains; alts resolved earlier).
 * - events: ordered list of SplitEvent records attributed during this segment.
 * - settlementConfigAtStart/end: calculation context stored on mother sessions for historical metrics.
 * <p>
 * Lifecycle notes
 * - A thread starts by creating a mother + an initial child (active). Events are written to the
 * active child only. If a roster mutation happens and the current child already has events,
 * ManagerSession ends the current child and creates a new child with a copied roster and the
 * mutation applied. If there are no events yet, the roster is edited in-place on the current child.
 * - Stopping a thread ends the active child, and if the mother is still open, it is ended too.
 * <p>
 * Persistence/serialization
 * - This model is Gson-serializable; SessionStorage persists session data as versioned JSON in
 * the plugin's per-profile .runelite directory. Instant fields are serialized via a custom adapter.
